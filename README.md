# SmartESB: Smartbox Integration Framework bundle

This library is an Integration Framework built on top of Symfony. It allows to define and execute integration workflows with building blocks based on the [Enterprise Integration Patterns](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/).

Some of those building blocks allow for example to route and transform information or to send/read information from different technologies: Queues, SQL databases, NoSQL databases, REST and SOAP webservices, etc. 

This library is currently used internally in the Enterprise Application Integration layer of the [Smartbox Group](http://smartbox.com).


## Current status 

This library is **NOT stable** yet. We are currently working on creating a detailed documentation that will be published here soon.

If you are interested in knowing more you can have a first look at the code and contact the [Integration team](mailto:si-integration@smartbox.com) at Smartbox.
